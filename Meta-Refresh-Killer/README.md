&lt;noscript&gt;
  &lt;meta&#32;http-equiv&equals;&apos;REFRESH&apos;&#32;content&equals;&apos;0&semi;URL&equals;&period;&period;&period;&apos;
&lt;&sol;noscript&gt;

⧣𝟰 Disable JavaScript and cookies globally
(chrome://settings/content)

You can later enable them just for few safe websites.

You can safely enable JS&cookies for Google, YouTube and Facebook, by adding those entries:
[*.]google.com
[*.]youtube.com
[*.]facebook.com
to:
(chrome://settings/contentExceptions#cookies)
(chrome://settings/contentExceptions#javascript)

You easily enable new websites in-case needed using the new icons for disabled JS/cookies on the your address-bar.
