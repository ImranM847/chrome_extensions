Helps you to use CTRL+A in PRE and CODE elements.

You can even use them as mini-editor to save you time instead of copying them to another 3<sup>rd</sup>-party editor.
This is also makes especially easy to edit Unicode/UTF-8 content since browsers natively supports it.

8.0.1.3
* Google-translate easier copy of the result.

* code fix/cleanup.

8.0.0.9
+ adding github's danger-zone repository easy copy.

8.0.0.3
