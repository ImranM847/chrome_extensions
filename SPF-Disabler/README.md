<h3><em>★★★★★ Back To Standard Browsing! ꗷ︎</em></h3>

Disabling the SPF engine is quite easy,
all you have to do it add <code>/spf.js</code> to your uBlock-origin adblock-list...

<sub>read more about it in here: <a href="http://icompile.eladkarako.com/disable-youtube-spf/"><em>iCompile -</em> Disable YouTube SPF</a></sub>

<h3>But <strong>DON'T!</strong></h3>

many Google based websites do not have a proper fallback to standard-browsing anymore,
leaving you with much of the functionality missing,

Don't belive me?
Try YouTube with uBlock-origin and the custom rule: <code>/spf.js</code>.
Most of the menus will not respond well, and video-transitions in playlist will but unusable.

This is YouTube was not properly coded with a fallback in-case the JavaScript of SPF will be disabled, but the other functionality will kept enabled. So it is best to <strong>keep loading <code>/spf.js</code></strong>, but providing a workaround that will limit the usability of the loading-engine,

Effectivly giving you a <strong>SPF-Free</strong> website, without breaking anything.

<h3><em>SPF-Disabler</em> provides several solutions<br/>working heuristically side-by-side,<br/>Bringing you back the standard-browsing experience.</h3>
