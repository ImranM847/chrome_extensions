<h2>Reveal What Is Behind The Asterisks Of A Password On Mouse Hover.</h2>

<h3>Ever mistype a password, and were had to delete all the characters- and wrote the whole thing again?</h3>

I think hiding a password behind "*" on YOUR OWN PC is rather pointless.

so I've wrote this Chrome extension to help me copy & paste, 
or edit long passwords very easily,

and once you move your mouse-cursor away, it's hidden again!
Easy!
