<h1><img src="resources/icon.png" height="64" width="64"/> Chrome-Extension-SourceForge-Direct-Download</h1>

Download files directly, with no passing-through the waiting page,
all download-links on the page will be rewritten to the download-file,
you can click, right click "save target as" or copy-and-paste to a your favorite download-manager,

<img src="resources/screenshot_1.png"/>
<img src="resources/screenshot_2.png"/>
<img src="resources/screenshot_3.png"/>
<img src="resources/screenshot_4.png"/>
<img src="resources/screenshot_5.png"/>

You both "save a click" and waiting time.

This extension is, also, friendly to SourceForge too (and you of-course..),
since it will you whatever download-mirror either you, (or SourceForge set for you) to download.

##This Extension Is A Great Time-Saver!
